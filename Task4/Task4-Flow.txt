In Task 4, we used RSA to create a Digital Signature. This process provides two critical security guarantees: Authenticity and Integrity.

The Mechanism

Hashing (The Fingerprint):
First, the sender (Alice) calculates a cryptographic hash (SHA-256) of the original message. This hash acts as a unique fingerprint of the data.

Signing (Encryption with Private Key):
Alice then encrypts this hash using her RSA Private Key.

Key Concept: Only Alice possesses her Private Key. Therefore, only Alice could have created this specific encrypted hash.

Verification (Decryption with Public Key):
The receiver (Bob) receives the message and the signature. He uses Alice's RSA Public Key to decrypt the signature.

Success: If the decryption works and reveals a hash, it mathematically proves that the signature was created by the corresponding Private Key (Alice's).

Failure: If the signature cannot be decrypted with Alice's Public Key, it was created by someone else.

Validation Summary

Authenticity: Since Bob successfully verified the signature using Alice's Public Key, he knows for certain that the message originated from Alice (or someone who stole her key).

Integrity: Bob also calculates his own hash of the received message. If it matches the hash he decrypted from the signature, he knows the message was not changed by even a single bit during transit.
